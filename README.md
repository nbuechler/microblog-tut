As the first three lessons of a Flask tutorial,and also an exercise to get up to speed with python, I reconfirmed that I could teach myself. Here's a link to the start of the tutorial: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

# Lessons Learned:
* The internet is a great place to go for resources, and they usually are free - which can be better than paying for a class.
* At the time, I was only partly familar with python, and Flask was recommended to me by another programmer. Learning to trust others is a good skill to have, and I'm thankful I gave this a shot because now Flask is a very useful tool in my utility belt (in 2016)
* I don't have to commit to completing a full project if I commit to a specific set of goals. In this case, the goal was to try out a new tool, and to use it in a valuable way. I accomplished this goal because I was able to build a form and send RESTful requests which at the time I had only seen possible in a vary narrow case.
